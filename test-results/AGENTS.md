# test-results — AGENTS

## Purpose

Stores outputs and artifacts from test runs and benchmarking (JSON results, snapshots, logs).

## Key files

- `.last-run.json` — Metadata for last test run.
- `ai-bench-*.json` — AI benchmark outputs.

## Dependencies

- Generated by test scripts and CI runs.

## Interactions

- Test runners and scripts write here; human reviewers read results to make decisions.

## Important notes

- Keep this folder out of critical builds; ensure CI cleans or archives large artifacts when needed.
