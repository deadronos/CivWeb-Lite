# TASK001 - Define Types and Utilities for Categories and States

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-09-12  
**Updated:** 2025-09-12

## Original Request

Implement Phase 1 from plan/plan-unit-states.md: Define types and utilities for unit categories and states.

## Thought Process

This phase establishes the foundational types and utilities needed for unit categories and multi-state support. Using enums for categories and states, and a Set for active states to allow multiples. Icon maps will reference react-icons/gi suggestions. Ensure TypeScript compliance and basic testing.

## Implementation Plan

- Define UnitCategory and UnitState enums in src/types/unit.ts
- Create icon maps in src/utils/unitIcons.ts
- Install react-icons if needed
- Update GameState interface
- Validate with TypeScript and Vitest

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

### Subtasks

| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 1.1 | Create/update src/types/unit.ts with UnitCategory enum and UnitState as enum; add type for `Set<UnitState>` or UnitActiveStates as array/set. | Completed | 2025-09-12 | Green: Enums implemented in src/types/unit.ts; tests pass with exact values. UnitActiveStates supports multi-states (e.g., Set with Moved + Fortified). |
| 1.2 | Add unitCategoryIconMap and unitStateIconMap in src/utils/unitIcons.ts, using react-icons/gi (e.g., GiHourglass for Idle, GiFootsteps for Moved). Reference suggested-states-icons.md for icons. | Completed | 2025-09-12 | Green: Maps implemented/tested; JSDoc added for multi-state badges. |
| 1.3 | Install react-icons if not present: npm i react-icons. | Completed | 2025-09-12 | Installed successfully (npm i). |
| 1.4 | Update GameState interface in src/types/game.ts to include category: UnitCategory and activeStates: `Set<UnitState>` per unit. | Completed | 2025-09-12 | Green: Extended Unit with category (UnitCategory) and activeStates (empty Set initial); test passes (props defined, size=0). Integrates enums for REQ-005 reducer multi-add (e.g., 'Idle' on turn). |
| 1.5 | Validate: Run tsc and ensure no type errors; add basic Vitest for enum values and set operations. | Completed | 2025-09-12 | Green: tsc clean on all files; extended game-state.test.ts with set ops (single/multi .add/.has/size—2/2 pass, e.g., size=2 for Moved + Fortified). Total 9/9 across Phase 1. |

## Progress Log

### 2025-09-12

- Green for Subtask 1.1: Added enums and UnitActiveStates type to src/types/unit.ts; tests now pass (2/2).
- Fixed test import resolution; verified no type errors (tsc clean).
- Multi-state ready: Enums ensure only valid states in sets (e.g., no invalid combos at type level).
- Green for Subtask 1.2: Added src/utils/unitIcons.ts with switch-based functions; maps return correct Gi* (2/2 tests pass).
- Subtask 1.3: react-icons installed (terminal confirm).
- Multi-state ready: Maps safe for Set<UnitState> (e.g., render multiple icons for active states like Moved + Fortified in badges).
- Full Green for 1.2: Fixed icon mismatch (GiScout for Recon), braces in switch, undefined returns, filename to kebab-case; tests 2/2 pass.
- Lints cleared; multi-state ready: Maps iterate safely over Set<UnitState> for badges (e.g., multiple icons for Moved + Fortified).
- Green fixes for 1.2: Explicit {} in switches; test expects undefined for invalid; 2/2 pass.
- Green fixes 1.2: Test expects undefined for invalid (2/2 pass); multi-state badges safe (iterate set, skip undefined).
- Green 1.4: Added category/activeStates to Unit in game.ts; test verifies types/Set (1/1 pass; reducer-ready for .add('Idle') etc.).
- Subtask 1.5 Green: tsc no errors; extended game-state.test.ts with UnitActiveStates ops (add 'Idle', multi Moved + Fortified; 2/2 pass).
- Subtask 1.5 Green: Fixed import for set tests; all 7/7 pass (tsc clean).
- Phase 1 complete: Foundation ready for badges/reducer (multi-states via sets + icons).
- Refactored unit-icons.test.ts: forEach → for...of (lint fixed; tests still 2/2 green).
- Added JSDoc to maps in unit-icons.ts (docs params/returns for badges/multi-state safety).
- Green for Subtask 1.4: Fixed test import (value for UnitCategory.Melee); extended game.ts Unit with category/activeStates (Set empty initial). Test 1/1 pass; tsc clean.
- Multi-state: Extension supports .add('Moved') etc. in sets (size>1 for combos); ready for 1.5 ops tests.
- Green for Subtask 1.5: tsc clean (no errors in types/utils/game.ts); added set ops tests to game-state.test.ts (single/multi add/has/size pass). Verifies multi-state (e.g., .add('Idle') for turn, combos size=2).
- Phase 1 complete: 9/9 tests, tsc clean; ready for Phase 2 badges (render from maps/set) and Phase 3 reducer (dispatch .add to activeStates).
- Refactor: Consolidated Phase 1 tests into tests/types-utils.test.ts (9 tests: enums, icons, state, set ops).
- Old Phase 1 files deleted (unit-types.test.ts, unit-icons.test.ts, game-state.test.ts).
- Phase 1 remains 100% (9/9 pass).
