# TASK062 - Add Testing for UI Interactions

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-09-13  
**Updated:** 2025-09-13

## Original Request

Add comprehensive testing for new UI interactions as outlined in plan-full-ui-logic.md, including unit, integration, and E2E tests for unit movement, city production, and research selection.

## Thought Process

Testing ensures reliability of interactive features. This task covers unit tests for components, integration for state flows, and E2E for user journeys. Prioritize coverage of edge cases like invalid moves, prerequisite failures, and queue operations. Use existing test utils and Playwright for browser simulation.

## Implementation Plan

- Write unit tests for all new React components (MovementRangeOverlay, CityPanel, ResearchPanel, etc.) using Vitest and React Testing Library.
- Write integration tests simulating user interactions (clicks, hovers) and asserting state changes and dispatched actions.
- Write E2E tests using Playwright for critical flows: unit selection -> move -> combat; city panel -> queue production -> advance turn; research panel -> select tech -> queue.
- Ensure test coverage meets project standards (aim for 80%+).
- Run tests and fix any failures introduced by new code.
- Update test documentation if needed.
