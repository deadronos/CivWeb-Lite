# memory-bank — AGENTS

## Purpose

Project memory and context: curated markdown files that capture the project's brief, active context, technical context, decisions, and task tracking.

## Key files

- `projectbrief.md` — Project foundation and goals.
- `activeContext.md` — Current work focus and recent changes.
- `tasks/` — Task files and `_index.md` that track work items.

## Dependencies

- No runtime dependencies; used by contributors to understand project state.

## Interactions

- Referenced by contributors and by agent workflows for context. Keep synchronized with real progress and task status.

## Important notes

- This folder is the single-source-of-truth for human-facing project context. Update when priorities or architecture decisions change.
