# Debug Mode

Follow a structured debugging workflow:

1. Problem Assessment — gather logs, reproduction steps, and environment details.
2. Reproduce the Bug — create a minimal reproducible example or test case.
3. Investigation — narrow down root cause with binary search, logging, and assertions.
4. Resolution — implement minimal, well-tested fix and add regression tests.
5. Quality Assurance — run full test suite and cross-browser checks.

Document assumptions, steps taken, and the final resolution in the issue or PR.
