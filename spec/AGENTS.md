## Key files

- `game-layout-and-lifecycle.spec.md` — Layout and lifecycle behavior for game loop and scenes.
- `ui-interactions.spec.md` — Expected UI interactions and states.

## Dependencies

- Markdown only; used by contributors and reviewers.

## Interactions

- Specs inform tests under `tests/` and guide implementation in `src/`.

## Important notes

- Keep specs concise and testable. When a spec changes, update associated tests or add new ones.
